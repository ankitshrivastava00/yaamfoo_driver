   <p>Our vision is to is to reach out to all the tea lovers with the best quality and refreshing taste.</p>
   <h2>Blending</h2>
   <p>Tea sold to the customer is a combination of as many as  10-15 teas of varying characteristics from a wide range of plantations of Assam And Darjelling.

   <h2>Brewing</h2>
   <p>A tea infusion is best made by pouring water just brought to the boil over dry tea in a warm teapot and steeping it from three to five minutes. The liquor is separated from the spent leaves and may be flavored with milk or sugar</p>
   <h2>Tasting</h2>
   <p> The appearance of both the dry and infused leaf is observed, and the aroma of vapour, color of liquor, and creaming action (formation of solids when cooled) are assessed. Finally the liquor is taken into the mouth with a sucking noise, swirled around the tongue, brought into contact with the palate, cheek, and gums, and then drawn to the back of the mouth and up to the olfactory nerve in the nose before being expectorated. The liquor is tasted, and aroma is felt. Its rich colour, refreshing flavour and hypnotic aroma is unmistakable. Its legacy is indisputable. </p>
   <p>Today 287 Merry Tea is one of the leading packaged tea companies in Sagar district of Madhya Pradesh and is considered as one of the most trusted beverage brands. 287 Merry tea is blended to perfection and approved by tea tasters.

This journey has been successful due to the proprietor Mr. Surendra Jain and it’s team members , who have worked tirelessly towards its success story!</p>
   <p>In India, chai is more than just a cup of tea to start the day - the thick sweet drink is an integral part of the rhythm of life.Tea is history, solidarity, democracy, diversity and popular culture all amalgamated into one cup.</p>
   <h2>ABOUT TEA</h2>
   <p>Tea is India’s best loved beverage, and for most Indians, it is mankind’s greatest discovery. India is the world’s second largest producer of tea and most of its production is geared to meet domestic demand. Per capita consumption of tea has been growing steadily for the past fifty years and, today Indians consume a whopping 837,000 tonnes of the stuff.</p>
   <p>Given how ubiquitous a cup of chai is across India, and how chai drinking transcends all boundaries, it may come as a surprise to learn that it is a fairly recent national addiction. </p>
   <p>Chai is not just tea made Indian style — it literally is India in a teacup/ kulhad. Because everyone has their own rules for the container that makes tea taste best.</p>
   <p>Firstly, tea is India’s great leveller. Everyone drinks tea — the labourer, the office peon, the grandmother, the teacher, the student, the domestic worker, the prime minister and the pseudo secularist. And, whether it’s cutting chai in an Irani café, or first flush Darjeeling in a porcelain cup lifted delicately with a raised pinky or increasingly — green tea drunk by those whose bank balance and credulity are both generously proportioned — it is essentially the same experience being consumed. Across the Indian socio-economic-educational spectrum, chai is a momentary stop in the business of the day, a punctuation mark, a time of reflection, refreshment and respite and often — a time for conversation and conviviality.</p>
   <p>Chai is Indian hospitality at its best — every single visitor to an Indian home (including domestic workers and visitors' drivers) is offered a cup. </p>
   <p>The fact that chai is now not just a beverage, but woven into the fabric of this nation is hard to dispute. "Chai-chai-garam" has woken up several billion more Indians on Indian Railways than "coffee-nescoffee" ever could. </p>
